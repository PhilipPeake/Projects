UnboundID Identity Proxy 5.1.5.2
Please wait while the setup program initializes...

Would you like to add this server to an existing Identity Proxy topology? (yes / no) [no]: 

Enter the fully qualified host name or IP address of the local host [training1.trn]: 

Create the initial root user DN for the Identity Proxy [cn=Directory Manager]: 

Create a password for the initial root user: 
Re-enter the password for confirmation: 

Do you want to enable the SCIM and Configuration APIs? (yes / no) [no]: 

On which port should the Identity Proxy accept connections from LDAP clients? [2389]: 11389

Do you want to enable LDAPS? (yes / no) [no]: 

Do you want to enable StartTLS? (yes / no) [no]: 

By default the server listens on all available network interfaces for client connections.  Would
you like to specify particular addresses on which this server will listen for client connections?
(yes / no) [no]: 

This server supports entry balancing.  In an entry balancing environment, entries immediately
beneath the balancing base DN are divided into disjoint subsets.  Each subset of data is handled
by a separate set of one or more directory server instances, which replicate this subset of data
between themselves

Do you anticipate configuring this Identity Proxy for entry balancing?  Choosing 'yes' will allow
you to specify that more memory be allocated to the server and tools (yes / no) [no]: 

An adequate amount of memory must be assigned to the server for optimal performance. Choose the
option that best characterizes how this installation should be allocated memory:

    1)  Aggressive       The system is dedicated to running only this server (use 2g of 7g total
                         memory)
    2)  Semi-Aggressive  The system will be shared by multiple server processes (use 1888m of 7g
                         total memory)
    3)  Minimal          Use the bare minimum memory (256m) -- useful for evaluating product
                         functionality at a small scale only
    4)  Manual           Enter the amount of memory explicitly

Enter option: 4

Enter the maximum amount of memory to be allocated to the server and tools. The format for this
value is the same as the -Xmx JVM option which is a number followed by a unit m or g. A value
between '256m' and '2g' is recommended [2g]: 512m

Do you want to start the server when the configuration is completed? (yes / no) [yes]:
