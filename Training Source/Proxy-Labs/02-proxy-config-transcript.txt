>>>> Create Initial Proxy Configuration

This tool is used to configure a basic Identity Proxy.  The tool will prompt for basic information
about your topology including directory server instances, their locations, and the credentials for
communicating with them.  This tool will record the configuration in a dsconfig batch file and
apply the configuration to the local Identity Proxy.

The following assumptions are made about the topology to expedite setup:

	1) All servers will be accessible via a single user account
	2) All servers support the same communication security type
	3) All servers are UnboundID, Alcatel-Lucent 8661, Sun 
	   Java System 5.x, 6.x, or 7.x, or Red Hat (including Fedora and 389) 
	   directory servers

If your topology does not meet these assumptions, use this tool to define a basic configuration
and then use the 'dsconfig' tool or the web console to customize the configuration.

Continue with Initial Proxy Configuration? (yes / no) [yes]: 


>>>> External Server Access Credentials

Create the DN of the root account used to communicate with directory server instances.  In a later
step, this tool will create this account or set its password for each directory server instance
you specify.

Create the DN for the proxy user account [cn=Proxy User,cn=Root DNs,cn=config]: 

Create a password for 'cn=Proxy User,cn=Root DNs,cn=config': 
Confirm the password for 'cn=Proxy User,cn=Root DNs,cn=config': 



>>>> External Server Communication Security

Specify the type of security that the Identity Proxy will use when communicating with directory
server instances:

    1)  None
    2)  SSL
    3)  StartTLS

    b)  back
    q)  quit

Enter option [1]: 


>>>> Proxy Base DNs

A subtree view includes a single base DN used to define portions of the external servers' DIT to
make available to clients of the Identity Proxy.  This tool will configure a subtree view for
every base DN specified.

Enter a base DN of the directory server instances that will be accessed through the Identity
Proxy:

    b)  back
    q)  quit

Enter a DN or choose a menu item [dc=example,dc=com]: 

Are entries within 'dc=example,dc=com' split across multiple servers so that each server stores
only a subset of the entries (i.e. is this base DN 'entry balanced')? (yes / no) [no]: 


>>>> Proxy Base DNs

A subtree view includes a single base DN used to define portions of the external servers' DIT to
make available to clients of the Identity Proxy.  This tool will configure a subtree view for
every base DN specified.

Enter another base DN of the directory server instances that will be accessed through the Identity
Proxy:

    1)  Remove dc=example,dc=com

    b)  back
    q)  quit

Enter a DN or choose a menu item [Press ENTER when finished entering base DNs]: 


>>>> Define Locations

Locations are used to define collections of servers which may have similar performance
characteristics when accessed from this Identity Proxy. For example, a separate Location may be
defined for each data center.

Locations can represent the names of your data centers or the cities in which they are located.

    b)  back
    q)  quit

Create a location or choose a menu item: LOCATION1

    1)  Remove LOCATION1

    b)  back
    q)  quit

Create another location name or choose a menu item [Press ENTER when finished creating locations]: LOCATION2

    1)  Remove LOCATION1
    2)  Remove LOCATION2

    b)  back
    q)  quit

Create another location name or choose a menu item [Press ENTER when finished creating locations]: 


>>>> Proxy Location

Choose the location for this Identity Proxy

    1)  LOCATION1
    2)  LOCATION2

    b)  back
    q)  quit

Enter option [1]: 


>>>> Location 'LOCATION1' Details
 >>>> External Servers

External Servers identify directory server instances including host, port, and authentication
information.

Enter the host:port of the first directory server in 'LOCATION1':

    b)  back
    q)  quit

Enter a host:port for LDAP communication or choose a menu item [training1.trn:389]: training1.trn:1189

During this step, this tool checks for the existence of the proxy user account and allows you to
create it or set its password as necessary.  If you defer this step at this time you can later use
the prepare-external-server tool to perform this function.

Would you like to prepare training1.trn:1189 for access by the Identity Proxy?

    1)  Yes
    2)  No
    3)  Yes, and all subsequent servers
    4)  No, and all subsequent servers
