>>>> Create Initial Synchronization Configuration

This tool is used to configure a basic Identity Data Sync Server configuration.  The tool will
prompt for basic information about your topology including directory server instances and
credentials for communicating with them.  This tool will record the configuration in a dsconfig
batch file and apply the configuration to the local Identity Data Sync Server.

Continue with Sync Pipe Configuration? (yes / no) [yes]: 


>>>> Synchronization Mode

There are two types of Sync Pipe: "standard" and "notification." A standard Sync Pipe fetches the
full entries from both the source and destination and compares them to produce the minimal set of
changes to bring the destination into sync. A notification Sync Pipe skips the fetch, compares
phases of processing, notifies the destination that a change has happened, and provides it with
the details of the change. Notifications are currently only supported from UnboundID and
Alcatel-Lucent servers.

How should changes be synchronized?

    1)  Standard mode (preferred)
    2)  Notification mode

    q)  quit

Enter option [1]: 


>>>> Synchronization Direction

The Identity Data Sync Server can synchronize changes one way (from a source to a destination
endpoint) or in both directions so that changes made at either endpoint are synchronized.

What type of configuration would you like to create?

    1)  One way
    2)  Bi-directional

>>>> Sync Pipe 'UBID-Source_to_UBID-Dest' Sync Class Definitions

A Sync Class defines how a single class or type of entry (e.g. user entries) are synchronized in a
Sync Pipe.  A Sync Class allows different types of entries to be synchronized differently. For
example, some types of entries might have different attribute mappings, different DN construction,
or different types of operations synchronized (e.g. modifies but not creates).  A Sync Class can
also be used to completely exclude certain types of entries from synchronization.

one or more Sync Classes? (yes / no) [no]:
