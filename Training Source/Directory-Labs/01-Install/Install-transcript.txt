UnboundID Identity Data Store 5.1.5.2
Please wait while the setup program initializes...

Enter the fully qualified host name or IP address of the local host [training1.trn]: 

Create the initial root user DN for the Identity Data Store [cn=Directory Manager]: 

Create a password for the initial root user: 
Re-enter the password for confirmation: 

Do you want to enable the SCIM and Configuration APIs? (yes / no) [no]: 

On which port should the Identity Data Store accept connections from LDAP clients? [1389]: 1189

Do you want to enable LDAPS? (yes / no) [no]: 

Do you want to enable StartTLS? (yes / no) [no]: 

By default the server listens on all available network interfaces for client connections.  Would
you like to specify particular addresses on which this server will listen for client connections?
(yes / no) [no]: 

What do you wish to use as the base DN for the directory data? [dc=example,dc=com]: 
Options for populating the database:

    1)  Only create the base entry
    2)  Leave the database empty
    3)  Import data from an LDIF file
    4)  Load automatically-generated sample data

Enter option [1]: 4
Please specify the number of user entries to generate: [2000]: 

An adequate amount of memory must be assigned to the server for optimal performance. Choose the
option that best characterizes how this installation should be allocated memory:

    1)  Aggressive       The system is dedicated to running only this server (use 3776m of 7g total
                         memory)
    2)  Semi-Aggressive  The system will be shared by multiple server processes (use 1888m of 7g
                         total memory)
    3)  Minimal          Use the bare minimum memory (256m) -- useful for evaluating product
                         functionality at a small scale only
    4)  Manual           Enter the amount of memory explicitly

Enter option: 4

Enter the maximum amount of memory to be allocated to the server and tools. The format for this
value is the same as the -Xmx JVM option which is a number followed by a unit m or g. A value
between '256m' and '3776m' is recommended [3776m]: 512m

Do you want to automatically prime the database contents by loading backends into memory before
accepting connections? (yes / no) [no]: 

Do you want to start the server when the configuration is completed? (yes / no) [yes]:
